# StockPricePredictionAndForecasting

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using time series forecasting models, specifically ARIMA and SARIMA. By analyzing historical stock market data, the models capture trends, seasonality, and patterns to generate accurate future price predictions. ARIMA is used for non-seasonal forecasting, while SARIMA accounts for seasonal variations, enhancing accuracy. The project helps investors and analysts make informed decisions by providing a reliable 100-day stock price forecast.
